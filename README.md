# Custom Web Profiles

Custom web profiles to use as a link on Discord or other platforms. I made this originally inspired by guns.lol, a site where you make your own profile prettier to link it on discord. I wanted to learn how to do it myself in a more basic and free way.

**If you would like to contribute your own page, I would be delighted to receive it!**
