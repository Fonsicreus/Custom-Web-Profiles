# Custom-Web-Profiles
I made this originally inspired by guns.lol, a site where you make your own profile prettier to link it on discord. I wanted to learn how to do it myself in a more basic and free way.
I got the background video of the satella website from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XJAiHD8rXQ
